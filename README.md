## What is TypeScript

TypeScript is an open-source language which builds on JavaScript, one of the worldâ€™s most used tools, by adding static type definitions.

Typescript is the super set for javascript

## install
```
npm install nodemon
npm install -g typescript
```
## create tsconfig
```
tsc --init
```

## compile
```
tsc index.ts
```

typescript will be transferred to javascript and finally running.
